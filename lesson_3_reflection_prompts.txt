When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working in collaboration with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

    Because the remote repository could have changes that I don't want in my local
    files at that moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

    repository into your computer. A branch is the name given to a series of
    commits and what is pushed to a repository.

stored locally?
